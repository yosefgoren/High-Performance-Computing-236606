\subsection*{Introduction}
In this project, we take the 3D Sedov-Taylor simulation, specifically the
one found in the ScalSALE\cite{scalsale} paper implementation.\\
We start off from the original code written in Fortran 90, 
and go through a series of steps towrads optimizing the run on our specific
hardware to get the shortest possible run time.\\
While the first part will be run fully on the CPU and the runtimes will be measured,
the second part will be only theoretical - examining what should potentially
be the best parts of the code to offload to a GPU, considering workloads,
transfer times e.t.c.\\
The project with the source for
it's final CPU implementation can be found at the github \cite{this_repo}.

\subsection*{Tools}
For the purposes of CPU parallalization - \emph{openMP} was used.
Additionally, \emph{Intel VTune} was used to profile the code and
find the most time consuming loops.
