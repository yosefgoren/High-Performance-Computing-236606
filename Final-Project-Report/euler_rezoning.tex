Continuing the code from the CPU Optimization
part, we run our simulation on with Euler Rezoning
and get a runtime of 3.79 seconds per cycle.\\

Vtune analysis on 'HPC' mode shows
a function named 'calculate\_advect\_3d' 
as the biggest sequential bottleneck in the code - 
taking up 46.2\% of the serial runtime.\\

The procedure consists of a few nested loops.
Starting by parallelizing the largest one is simple
enough by adding the appropriate directives and identifying the private variables.\\
A noteworthy addition to this is a few places
where the procedure accesses
tensors in neighboring cells, requires use the secure this access
\footnote{i.e. writes to 'vof\_adv','mat\_vof\_adv','mat\_cell\_mass\_adv','sie\_vof\_adv'
and 'init\_mat\_layers\_adv'}
.
This has been done using the 'atomic' directive,
and similarly with the 
tensor.

Parallelizing this this loop gets us to
a runtime of 1.901 seconds per cycle.
This putting us at a speedup of $\times 1.993$
(and even more considering 'Calculate\_vertex\_mass\_3d'
was already parallelized from the original CPU Optimizations part).\\
