In the following experiments, we are running on a NUMA system consisting of
2 NUMA nodes, each with 2 sockets, each with 6 cores.
Each core has 2 hardware threads. So 24 hardware threads in total.\\
The CPU's themselves are \emph{Intel Xeon Gold 6128}, running between 1.2 to 3.7 GHz.\\
This is hardware available on \emph{Intel devcloud}\cite{devcloud_landing}.
